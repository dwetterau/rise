## What is this?
Rise is an open source android application that functions as an alarm clock to
help you get out of bed in the morning. This is done by requiring you to scan
a picture of a smiley face before the alarm will turn off.

# Setup
- Build the android application and install the .apk on your phone.
- Print out or draw the image below somewhere that you will have to walk to
for the alarm to turn off ![Simely face](rise.png)
- Set your alarm in the app to the times and days you want
